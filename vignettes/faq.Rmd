## TLDR: FAQ and Design Decisions

* Why are all the transformation functions prefixed with "str_"? 

This matches the convention of the  _stringr_ and _stringi_ packages. This helps
aviod name collisions. 


* Why all the aliasing of functions?  Why so many functions that do the same 
thing with different names?

Mainly, because we couldn't agree on the names and sometimes two different names
refer to the same type of formatting. Rather than enforce the use of something 
someone is not used to, we decided to be liberal with the aliases.


* Why don't you support _X_ formatting?

Send us the spec and we might?
